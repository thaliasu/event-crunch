# event-crunch
A mashup of BandsInTown and Google Maps APIs.

To use Event-Crunch for development purposes, do the following:
  1.) Change the database credentials in include/connect.inc.php.
  2.) Change the Maps API key located on line 89 of index.php.
  3.) Additionally, you may remove the script located in the <head> of index.php. This causes an alert box to pop up for first-time visitors.

For quickstart testing:
  1.) Search "SZA" and "New York". The page needs inputs for both artist and location.
  2.) Login as bananaseeds. The password is SarahB1!

Please enjoy!
