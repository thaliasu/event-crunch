# event-crunch
<b>A mashup of BandsInTown and Google Maps APIs.

To use Event-Crunch for development purposes, do the following:</b><br>
  1.) Change the database credentials in include/connect.inc.php.<br>
  2.) Change the Maps API key located on line 89 of index.php.<br>
  3.) Additionally, you may remove the script located in the <head> of index.php. This causes an alert box to pop up for first-time visitors.<br>

<b>For quickstart testing:</b><br>
  1.) Search "SZA" and "New York". The page needs inputs for both artist and location.<br>
  2.) Login as bananaseeds. The password is SarahB1!<br>

<b>Please enjoy!</b>
